    "### Dataset #1 \n"### Dataset #1: County-Level Daily COVID-19 Case Counts (USA)

This dataset contains daily reported COVID-19 case counts at the county-day level in the United States. Each observation represents the number of newly reported COVID-19 cases in a specific county on a given date. Case counts are measured in absolute units (number of confirmed cases per day) and reflect positive test results aggregated by public health authorities.

The variables most relevant to this project include county identifiers, date, and daily new COVID-19 case counts. These variables allow us to analyze temporal patterns in reported COVID-19 cases, including variation by day of the week, and to align case trends with other county-level predictors such as population mobility metrics.

This dataset has several limitations. Reported case counts are influenced by testing availability, reporting delays, and administrative practices that vary across counties and over time. Weekend underreporting and delayed backfilling may introduce artificial fluctuations unrelated to true transmission dynamics. Additionally, reported cases likely underestimate total infections due to asymptomatic cases and uneven access to testing.
