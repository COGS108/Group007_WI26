    "We hypothesize that daily COVID-19 case counts (daily_cases) will vary systematically across days of the week, with lower reported cases on weekends (is_weekend = 1) and higher reported cases during weekdays.

"## Data\n",
"\n",
"### Ideal Dataset\n",
"\n",
"The ideal dataset for our research question would include daily county-level COVID-19 case data combined with daily mobility metrics for the same counties over time. Key variables needed include `date`, `county`, `daily_cases`, `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, `workplaces`, and `residential`, as well as other mobility categories such as `retail_recreation`, `transit`, and `parks`. County identifiers such as `fips` are necessary to track observations consistently across time.\n",
"\n",
"To properly evaluate differences across days of the week and associations with mobility, we need daily observations for multiple counties over an extended period (at least one year). Since our dataset contains daily observations per county, this results in thousands of rows (number of counties × number of days), which is sufficient for time-series and association analysis.\n",
"\n",
"Ideally, case data would be collected from verified public health reporting systems, and mobility data would be collected from aggregated and anonymized smartphone location tracking systems. The dataset should be organized in a tidy format where each row represents one county on one date, and each column represents a variable.\n",
"\n",
"### Real Dataset Used\n",
"\n",
"We are using a pre-integrated dataset (`IntegratedData.csv`) that already combines daily COVID-19 case data and mobility metrics at the county level. Important variables include:\n",
"\n",
"- `daily_cases` (primary outcome variable)\n",
"- `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, and `is_holiday` (temporal indicators)\n",
"- `workplaces` and `residential` (primary mobility predictors)\n",
"- Additional mobility variables such as `retail_recreation`, `transit`, and `parks`\n",
"\n",
"This dataset allows us to directly test our hypothesis regarding systematic differences in daily cases across days of the week and associations between mobility behavior and COVID-19 case counts over time.\n"

  "### A. Data Collection\n",
  " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
  "\n",
  "Our analysis uses publicly available, aggregated county-level COVID-19 case counts and mobility metrics. We do not recruit participants, interact with individuals, or collect new individual-level data, so informed consent is not required for our work. However, we acknowledge that mobility metrics originate from smartphone location signals and that many users may not fully understand downstream secondary uses, even when data is anonymized and aggregated.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
  "\n",
  "Mobility data can underrepresent people without smartphones or stable location services (for example older adults, low income communities, unhoused populations, and some rural areas). COVID-19 case counts also reflect testing access and reporting practices that vary by county and over time. We will interpret findings as population-level associations and avoid claims that assume equal measurement quality across all counties or groups.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
  "\n",
  "Our dataset is already aggregated to county-day level and does not include direct identifiers (names, addresses, device IDs). We will not attempt any re-identification or linkage to external individual-level datasets. We will also avoid presenting results as county rankings intended to label places as good or bad.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
  "\n",
  "Our results could be misused to blame specific regions or communities for COVID-19 spread or to justify punitive policy based on mobility patterns. We will present conclusions carefully, emphasizing that mobility is a proxy for many structural factors and that associations do not imply individual fault or causation. Where feasible, we will add contextual covariates (for example population, time controls, fixed effects) and include limitations that discourage stigmatizing interpretations.\n",
  "\n",
  "### B. Data Storage\n",
  " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
  "\n",
  "The data are public and aggregated, so the risk level is low, but we will still follow basic security practices: keep data in the course GitHub repo, avoid sharing raw data outside the team, and ensure devices/accounts used to access the repo are protected. We will not store any private keys or credentials in the repository.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
  "\n",
  "Because the dataset does not contain individual-level identifiers, individuals cannot be singled out or removed from our data. We rely on the data providers' governance and opt-out mechanisms (if any). Our project does not maintain user-level records.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
  "\n",
  "We will keep the dataset only as long as needed for the course and reproducibility of the final report. After the course, we can remove large raw data files from the repo while retaining derived results and code that do not contain sensitive information.\n",
  "\n",
  "### C. Analysis\n",
  " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
  "\n",
  "Public health outcomes depend on factors not captured by mobility (healthcare access, workplace protections, housing density, local policy, and reporting practices). We will check our assumptions using public health context from reputable sources and discuss limitations so our results are not interpreted as purely behavioral explanations.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
  "\n",
  "We expect bias from uneven testing/reporting, time-varying policy changes, and demographic differences across counties. We will use appropriate controls (time effects, county fixed effects, lagged outcomes where relevant) and perform basic robustness checks (for example examining patterns across time periods) to reduce the chance of misleading conclusions.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
  "\n",
  "We will avoid causal wording and report results as associations. Visualizations will clearly label units and transformations, and we will include uncertainty or variability where possible. We will not cherry-pick dates or counties to support a preferred conclusion.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
  "\n",
  "No PII is present in the dataset and none will be introduced. We will only analyze and display aggregated county-level metrics.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
  "\n",
  "All preprocessing, analysis steps, and figure generation will be documented in notebooks/scripts in the repository. This supports reproducibility and makes it easier to identify issues if errors or data problems are later discovered.\n",
  "\n",
  "### D. Modeling\n",
  " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
  "\n",
  "Mobility measures can correlate with socioeconomic status and occupation types. We will not use models for individual-level prediction, and we will interpret results as structural and measurement patterns rather than traits of any group.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
  "\n",
  "We are not building a high-stakes decision system, but we can still check whether model residuals or fit vary across counties (for example by population size or region). If large differences appear, we will report them as limitations and avoid overgeneralizing.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
  "\n",
  "We will use standard regression evaluation (for example goodness of fit and error measures) but will prioritize interpretability and stability over optimizing a single metric. We will compare multiple reasonable specifications to ensure conclusions are not driven by one modeling choice.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
  "\n",
  "We will use interpretable models (for example linear regression with coefficients) and explain findings in plain language. We will tie interpretations directly to observed variables and note when the data do not justify a stronger claim.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
  "\n",
  "Our report will include a limitations section emphasizing that associations are not causation, case reporting varies by testing/reporting practices, and mobility metrics may not represent all populations equally. We will explicitly discourage stigmatizing or punitive interpretations.\n",
  "\n",
  "### E. Deployment\n",
  " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
  "\n",
  "We are not deploying a model in production. Still, we will sanity-check outputs (for example extreme spikes, missing dates, or inconsistent values) and document cleaning decisions to reduce errors in the final report.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
  "\n",
  "Because this is a course research analysis and not a deployed system, formal redress is not applicable. The main risk is misinterpretation, so we mitigate harm through careful framing, avoiding causal claims, and clearly stating limitations and appropriate uses.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
  "\n",
  "Not applicable because we are not deploying a production model. If issues are found, we can update or remove analyses in the repository and clearly note changes.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
  "\n",
  "Unintended use is possible if results are used to justify surveillance or punitive restrictions targeted at particular counties. We will avoid producing county rankings meant for enforcement decisions, use neutral language, and emphasize that mobility is an imperfect proxy that should not be used for punitive action.\n"
