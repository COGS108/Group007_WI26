"## Data\n",
"\n",
"### Ideal Dataset\n",
"\n",
"The ideal dataset for our research question would include daily county-level COVID-19 case data combined with daily mobility metrics for the same counties over time. Key variables needed include `date`, `county`, `daily_cases`, `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, `workplaces`, and `residential`, as well as other mobility categories such as `retail_recreation`, `transit`, and `parks`. County identifiers such as `fips` are necessary to track observations consistently across time.\n",
"\n",
"To properly evaluate differences across days of the week and associations with mobility, we need daily observations for multiple counties over an extended period (at least one year). Since our dataset contains daily observations per county, this results in thousands of rows (number of counties × number of days), which is sufficient for time-series and association analysis.\n",
"\n",
"Ideally, case data would be collected from verified public health reporting systems, and mobility data would be collected from aggregated and anonymized smartphone location tracking systems. The dataset should be organized in a tidy format where each row represents one county on one date, and each column represents a variable.\n",
"\n",
"### Real Dataset Used\n",
"\n",
"We are using a pre-integrated dataset (`IntegratedData.csv`) that already combines daily COVID-19 case data and mobility metrics at the county level. Important variables include:\n",
"\n",
"- `daily_cases` (primary outcome variable)\n",
"- `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`, and `is_holiday` (temporal indicators)\n",
"- `workplaces` and `residential` (primary mobility predictors)\n",
"- Additional mobility variables such as `retail_recreation`, `transit`, and `parks`\n",
"\n",
"This dataset allows us to directly test our hypothesis regarding systematic differences in daily cases across days of the week and associations between mobility behavior and COVID-19 case counts over time.\n"
